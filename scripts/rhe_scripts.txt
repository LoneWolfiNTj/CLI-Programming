INTRO:

This folder ("/rhe/scripts" = "D:\rhe\scripts") is for scripts. 

As of Fri Feb 19, 2021, most of the subfolders of "/rhe/scripts" are now organized by "usage", with names
which are pretty descriptive. These scripts are all intended to be executed from the BASH shell running on
Cygwin's MinTTY console on a Windows-10 computer:

apl
cryptography
filters
fractals
graphics
humor
math
perl-internals
science
test
util

However, the following folders are exceptions. These are are organized by command interpreter, and mostly
contain scripts which are are intended to be run on command interpreters other than BASH. In most cases
the command interpreter will also be the script interpreter; but in the case of "vbs" this is NOT so, as
Windows Script Host can launch script interpreters for multiple script languages:

Folder | Command Interpreter                                       | Meaning Of Folder Name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
au3    | AutoIt3 script interpreter                                | Auto It 3 (mostly Toontown-related)
dos    | Windows-10 DOS console                                    | Disk Operating System (mostly old stuff)
ps1    | Windows PowerShell console                                | Power Script 1 (unblocking, etc)
sls    | Second Life client apps (Second Life & Phoenix Firestorm) | Second Life Script (virtual world)
sps    | WinAmp media player GUI app                               | Signal Processing Studio (Winamp)
vbs    | Windows Script Host (C:\Windows\System32\wscript.exe)     | Visual Basic Script (Windows)

==============================================================================================================
NOTES ON SPECIFIC COMMAND INTERPRETERS:

AU3:
When icons for scripts written in the "Auto-It-3" scripting language are doubled-clicked, the linked scripts
are interpreted by the windowless "Auto-It-3" command-and-script interpreter. These scripts primarily automate
GUIs in apps, but some of them are GUI apps themselves (for example, my "Psychedelic Clock" program).
The majority of the scripts in /rhe/scripts/au3, though, are for automating various things in game programs
such as Toontown Rewritten and Wizard-101.

BASH:
Cygwin's BASH shell, which runs in the MinTTY console, can launch scripts written in many languages, including
BASH itself, Perl, Python, Sed, Awk, etc, etc, etc. To specify which script interpreter to launch, use a
"shebang" as the first line of your script, like so:
#! /bin/perl
#! /bin/bash
#! /bin/python
#! /bin/sed
#! /bin/awk

DOS:
The files in the subfolders of /rhe/scripts/dos are mostly DOS batch (*.bat) files, but also include a few
qbasic (*.qb) files. Most of these programs are very old and seldom-if-ever used.

PS1:
These are scripts written for the Windows PowerShell console. These include my VERY-useful script
"unblock.ps1" which "unblocks" downloaded files which Windows routinely "blocks". 

SLS:
These are scripts written for Second Life, and are command- and script- interpreted by Second Life clients,
including Second Life Reader and Phoenix Firestorm.

SPS:
These are "Signal Processing Studio" scripts written for WinAmp. (For example, to alter stereo separation for
headphones.)

VBS:
Windows Script Host can launch scripts written in JavaScript, Visual Basic Script, and PerlScript.
