My "CLI-Programming" repository is basically all of my home-brew command-line programs, both in "compiled" languages such as C and C++ and in "interpreted" languages such as Sed, Awk, Perl, Raku, and Python. These are all programs of my own creation and no one else owns any copyrights on them.

The purposes of these programs vary wildly. For some examples: "src/util" contains programs of general utility; "scripts/util" are primarily computer-system-maintenance programs; "games" is games; "humor" is humor; "test" is small programs designed to test some one language feature; etc.

I've put all of those on Github in case any of my fellow humans may find them useful. I do not think that these command-line programs are anything that anyone would pay me money for, so I'm not charging any. I just ask that if you share these, leave the attribution lines (eg, "Written by Robbie Hatley") intact.

(Now, if I create some full-featured GUI programs that I think the non-tech-savvy general public would be interested in paying money for, sure I'll charge money. But those programs will never appear HERE. THIS repository will contain freeware CLI programs only.)
