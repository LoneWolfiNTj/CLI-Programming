This folder (Cygwin path "/cygdrive/d/rhe/modules", Windows path "D:\rhe\modules")
is for Perl modules, primarily of my own design, written in for the Cygwin environment.

As of 2017-07-20, I have these 5 modules, all of my own design, all in subfolder RH:

Dir
Math
RegTest
Util
WinChomp

If I decide to include modules by other persons at a later date (not including
modules which are part of the Cygwin repository, which go in "C:\cygwin\.....")
I'll put them in subfolders of this folder other than RH.
