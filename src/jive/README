Here is the source for the four translators which backend 
the page http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jbc/home/chef.html

None of these programs is original with me; I just pulled
them off the net and did the frontend web page. I assume
you probably want to use these standalone, or that you are
going to write a web page and cgi script appropriate for
your own environment. If you want my .html and .cgi files,
I'll be happy to send them on request (but the .cgi script
probably won't work elsewhere without modification).

These all came from Unix environments, and depend on the
Unix "lex" utility to rebuild the C files. You'll also need
the "lex" libraries to link. In a Unix environment, you 
should only need to do a make -- I've provided a simple
Makefile to get you going.

Good luck.
